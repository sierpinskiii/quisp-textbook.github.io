# QuISP Contribution 101
If you got the idea of "using" the QuISP and got used to it a bit, it's time to consider your contribution to QuISP!  

Like other open source projects, there is more than one way to contribute to QuISP. You can write code to fix some minor/major issues, or add new functionalities, or work on documentation like this. This guide will focus on code writing, since other jobs are pretty same as other open source projects.
