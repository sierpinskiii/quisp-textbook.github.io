- Compiling/running with OMNeT++ in the first place fails, but if you do it again with bash and make, it works.

- Where is the so-called "entry point" of the entire quisp? How many binaries are there, and how they're interacting each other?

- How do we test (https://github.com/sfc-aqua/quisp/tree/master/test This looks fine, but we can add more explanation and context)

- How the C++ code and binary communicate with OmNeT++ (probably with .ned files, but still unclear)

- How to contribute? What is appreciated?

- Is there any example of fixing an issue and creating a pull request

- What exactly is the "RuleSet?"
