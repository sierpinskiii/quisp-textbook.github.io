# The Hitchhikerâ€™s Guide to the QuISP Development

> Rise and shine, Contributor. Rise and shine.  
> Not that I wish to imply you have been sleeping on the job. No one is more deserving of a rest. And all the effort in the world would have gone to waste until...well, let's just say your hour has come again.  
> The right man in the wrong place can make all the difference in the world.  
> So, wake up, Contributor. Wake up and smell the qubits.

Welcome onboard! This is your friendly guide to get started with QuISP development and contribution, including our issue solving. If you're reading this for the first time, that means you just sucessfully initiated your first step of contributing to the Quantum Internet Simulation Package we're working on. Well begun is half done!  

As of this very moment in 2023, we're actively working on this project (mainly in the Delta Building of Keio University SFC, Japan), and new engineers are welcome, regardless of quantum computing related experience/knowledge they have.
